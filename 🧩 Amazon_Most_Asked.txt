1. Reorder Data in Log Files
- Logic is basic, question must be clear.
- understand question in scratch before starting, that's all!

2. Sum of Subarray Ranges
- Is easy, we just need to form the subarrays and calculate max and min at each step

3. ðŸŒŸ All nodes distance k in binary tree
- Question was simple if it  was a graph
- Here difficlty is only that we need to traverse back as well
- Traversing back is not possible in tree! But with some extra work we can! How?
- Use map to store parent of each node! So that we can traverse back
- Also, make sure to use visited array so you don't come back from where traversing path for k

4. ðŸŒŸ Search Suggestion System (TRIE)
- Basic Trie Problem! Must be done before to do it timely :)
