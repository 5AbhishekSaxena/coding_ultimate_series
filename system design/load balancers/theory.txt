Load Balancers: Used to distribute load to servers

- Routing Algorithms used in Load Balancer:

1. Round Robin - Sequencially keep going to each server and when all covered, restart from starting again. (good if server are similar)
2. Least Connections - choose the server which has least no. of connections at that point.
3. Least System Load - choose the server which currently has least stress (a shell script could tell us) - if 2 system has 20 connections then the one with less stress will get priority (When don't want to overload server)
4. Least Response Time - keep checking the response time and choose the one which is currently taking the least time, no matters what's the connection or system load. (When fast response needed)
5. IP HASH - will use some function to choose a server like (%n) - assumed that perfectly distributes to all server.

>  Example: Nginx Server

- L4 & L7 Load Balancer:

L4 - TCP/UDP Routing
L7 - Http Routing, is much smarter than l4

4, 7 are the levels in OSI Model! Important to know OSI Network Model
