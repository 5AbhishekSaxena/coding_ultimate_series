> Timely eviction of data is important

- Cache eviction algorithms (Redis memory is limited can't keep huge data)
1. Least Recently Used (LRU): Data used least recently (old enough) is deleted 
2. Least Frequently Used (LFU): Data used least no. of times is deleted
3. Time To Live (TTL): A time is given to each data after which it's deleted
