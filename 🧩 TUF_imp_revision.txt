1. Inversion Count/ Reverse Pair ( both similar question )
- Basically we need to reduce complexity from O(N^2) to O(NlogN)
- And things could be little better we have have 2 sorted array where we can check the requirement
- And merge sort we have these arrays and hence we can easlily check it there
- ðŸŒŸ In Reverse Pair, the method where we check is important as that logic is little tricky yet easy!

2. Unique Path Problem (Google Interview)
- Use recursion for (2^N)
- Use DP for O(N^2)
- Use Optimised space in tabular
- ðŸŒŸ Use combinations - O(N) -> RRD, RDR...
