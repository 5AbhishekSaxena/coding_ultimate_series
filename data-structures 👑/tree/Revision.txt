Theoritical
1) BFS(breadth first search) & LOT(level order traversal) are same thing
> "search" and "traversal" can be used interchangeably.

=========================================================

1. Using QUEUE (push, pop)
> queue<type> q;
> q.push("hello");
> q.pop(); -> DOESN't RETURN ANY DATA !
> q.front(); -> RETURNS DATA AT FRONT !
> q.size(); -> RETURNS CURRENT SIZE/LENGTH OF QUEUE !
push is Last, pop is First - "LIFO"

2. "Similar to level order traversal with endl, it maybe asked"
Q) "On which level in Tree is '3' present?"
A) Just keep counting (NULL_count-1) <- answer (Because NULL gets added after each level)
  > Other alternative would be to send a flag and keep doing "+ 1"

3. Segmentation Fault May come during
  > Index out of bounds
  > queue.pop() - there is nothing in queue
  > If can't figure out, comment out code and check

4. Breadth First Search = Level Order Traversal
  > Search here indicates traversal 

5. Modulues | X | 
    > abs() for int
    > fabs() for double
    > fabsf() for float

6. Traversals Types (Depends upon 'root' position)
  6.1 InOrder Traversal
    > left/'root'/right
  6.2 PreOrder Traversal
    > 'root'/left/right
  6.3 PostOrder Traversal
    > left/right/'root'

7. Debugging in recursion: use cout<<
