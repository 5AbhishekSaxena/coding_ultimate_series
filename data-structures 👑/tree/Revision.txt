Theoritical
1) BFS(breadth first search) & LOT(level order traversal) are same thing
> "search" and "traversal" can be used interchangeably.

=========================================================

1. Using QUEUE (push, pop)
> queue<type> q;
> q.push("hello");
> q.pop(); -> DOESN't RETURN ANY DATA !
> q.front(); -> RETURNS DATA AT FRONT !
> q.size(); -> RETURNS CURRENT SIZE/LENGTH OF QUEUE !
push is Last, pop is First - "LIFO"


2. Similar to level order traversal with endl, it maybe asked 
Q) "On which level in Tree is 3 present?"
A) Just keep counting (NULL_count-1) <- answer!


3. Segmentation Fault May come during
  > Index out of bounds
  > queue.pop() - there is nothing in queue
  > If can't figure out, comment out code and check
