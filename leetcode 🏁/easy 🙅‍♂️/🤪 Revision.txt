1. c++ doesn't support string in switch as only primitive type are supported as 
    switch creates a lookup and optimises the operations.
    " Use Javascript as last resort "

2. No issues even if O(n^3) - sometimes that's the only possible way to do!

3. Iterating through a map
   > Initialize an iterator
        map<int,int>::iterator it;
        for(it=store.begin();it!=store.end();it++) {
            cout<< "Key1" << it->first;
            cout << "key2 << it->second;
        }
    
    // c++11 onwards
    for (auto x : symbolTable)
    {
            std::cout << x.first  // string (key)
              << ':' 
              << x.second // string's value 
              << std::endl;
    }
    
    // new way - c++17 !!
    for(auto [key,value]: store) {
        cout<< "key" << key << "value" << value;
    }

4. use unordered_map, as it's faster (sometimes, map is faster!)
