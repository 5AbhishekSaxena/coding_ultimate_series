/**
 * 
 * NOTE: Q can be done differently as well (taking index from N and then coming all the back to 0)
 * (here from 0 to N is done)
 * 
 * 
 * QUESTION: Height of pole are given
 * - Frog can jump to next or next of next only
 * - The price he pays for jump is difference in height
 * - Find the minimum price he needs to pay to reach end
 * 
 * 
 * LOGIC: As multiple ways are possible - this is clear case of recursion
 * - Hence we try to make a tree diagram of how to approach it
 * - Thinks in terms of index
 * 
 * ðŸš« BLUNDER: Do not try to do sum at each step and pass on to next stack
 * - This will result in different sub problems rather than similar
 * 
 * LOGIC AGAIN: Think in terms of index always
 * F(N) = min( F(N-1) + height[i]-height[i-1], F(N-2) + height[i] - height[i-2])
 * 
 * COMPLEXITY: O(N*2) ~ O(N)
 * - Each step we are calling -1, -2, even tho it's memoized
 *
