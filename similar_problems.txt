1. Sticker Thief (Array, DP) & Max Subset Sum (Tree)
    > Inclusion/Exclusion principle used in both

2. One Edit distance & Levenshtein problem
    > Both can be done using Levenshtein but one edit can be optimised

3. Merge sort & count inversions problem - both uses merge sort algo
    - important to understand why count inversions uses merge sort for optimization
    - smallest string: logic to understand is how we used merge sort here & why simple sort didn't work!

4. Quick Sort & kth largest item in array - both uses Quick Sort
    - important to understand how partitioning algo is reducing the complexity. (by not picking on half)

5. Monotonic Binary Search (Maximize the minimum subarray/distance/something)
    - Angry Birds
    - Game of Greed
    Minimize the Maximum
    - Reading Books (*)

6. Backtracking(Must do)
    - longest_possible_route
    - NQueens
    - rat_maze
    - sudoku_solver

7. Stack Questions (What is first Max on left?)
    - Next greater element
    - online stock span 
    important to understand why we used stack- simple cause we need to pop when it's smaller!

8. Heap/Priority Queue (k smallest/largest)
    - k nearest cabs
    - k largest number/ k smallest number
    - min cost to merge rope (uses PQ - reason is it needs min each time)
