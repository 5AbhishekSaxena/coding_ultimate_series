1. Mycalendar (Basic interval question only! sorting and all was not required here)
- LOGIC: No need of using sorting here, just think the basic thing
- Don't jump to advance level initially
- Here, simple checking with all the intervals worked fine

2. Substring with concatenation of all words (hard problem)
- LOGIC: Think basic level only. 
- Not a DP question, just keep a check on all the words
- And iterate through given string and see if all words are seen or not (NOTE: WORDS ARE SAME LENGTH SO THAT HELPED!)
