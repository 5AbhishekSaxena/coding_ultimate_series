What's BFS ?

- Let's get back to Tree...
- In tree, to print level order, we used to take a queue
- Tree is also a type of graph and that level order is what is called BFS
- In Graph cycles can be present so we additionally need to store which nodes are already visited
- In BFS, those nodes which are near to root will be printed first!
- Far away node will be printed last!
