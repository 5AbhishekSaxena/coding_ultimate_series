What's DFS?

- Let's get back to tree...
- We used to recursively traverse a tree - preOrder, postOrder, inOrder
- Now that traversal is what called as a DFS!
- In Graph, only difference is, here multiple bidirectional edges maybe present which can also be in a loop!

COMPLEXITY
- O(No. of nodes + No. of edges) - similar to BFS
