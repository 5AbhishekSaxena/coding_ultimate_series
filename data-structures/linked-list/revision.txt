Using List STL

> LIST INTRODUCTION
- List is doubly linked list, vector is singly linked list
- In List, fetching specific index won't be quick as vector... but other fn like add, delete is better

> LIST OPERATIONS
- push_back(2), pop_back(), front(), back(), reverse(), sort(), empty()
- insert(pointer, value), erase(list.begin(), advance(ptr, 2))

> USING advance ( To change pointer )
- advance(ptr, 2); //increase pointer to 2 steps

> ITERATING LIST
for(list<int>::iterator i=l.begin();i!=l.end();i++){
    cout<<*i;
}
