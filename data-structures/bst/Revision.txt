Q) What' a BST ?
A)
    > It's a Binary Tree ( All node have max 2 children )
    > Left node must be < Root
    > Right node must be >= Root
    > "=" can be on either direction, but not both

=> Binary Search Tree (Notes)
    > BST problems follow a 'recursive' structure
    > Mostly all problems are solved by diving problem into subproblems and making recursive calls on subtree
    > Inorder traversal is always sorted
    > BST makes 'searching efficient'
