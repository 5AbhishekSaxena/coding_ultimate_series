/**
 * QUESTIONS: Find running medians on each item insertion
 * 
 * LOGIC: Nai√©ve approach would be to insert each item & sort
 * - This would give high complexity of O(N^2logN)
 * 
 * Better complexity
 * - If we see closely....
 * - Median is the middle one in a sorted array
 * - We just want the max from left half
 * - & min from right half
 * - Min & max is something which heap implements very nicely
 * - Hence we are going to use Max Heap & Min Heap
 * - Max Heap will carry left side of array
 * - Min Heap will carry right side of array
 * - Make sure to either of heap doesn't carry more than difference of 1
 * 
 * - If item coming is more than median - means it should go to right side
 * - If max contain 2 and min 1 then if item is coming to max then shift top of max to min...
 * -... after that push item to max as difference shouldn't be more than 1.
 * 
 * - If items are equal, median would be a+b/2
 * - Else the top of heap which has more no. of item would be the median
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * COMPLEXITY: O(N(logN)^2)
 *
