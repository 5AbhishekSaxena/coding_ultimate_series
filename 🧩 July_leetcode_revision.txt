1. Wiggle Subsequence (alternate + and - difference, longest one)
- O(N^2) is easy as we just need need to keep pos, neg at each index and iterate
- But if we see clearly at each index we can use previous one. Keeping one same while increasing other if possible
- UPDATE: Top Down Approach (recursion) is done myself and understood clearly. Better to find recursive with memo way always!

2. Candy Problem ( the more priority child will get more candies than neighbour)
- First option is definitely Backtracking which gives TLE :( Hence do greedy approach
- Think of it as a graph problem where point at top will have more candy than neighbour
- Neighbour are at 2 sides left and right
- Hence we can first check from left to right and then from right to left, and finally do sum


3. Longest Consecutive Sequence (find consecutive from anywhere in array)
- Remember, for unordered_map and unordered_set, complexity on avg is O(1) hence we can make use of it
- Now to keep it O(1), a simple trick is to start counting consecutive only when previous doesn't exists
- Eg. for 100, 4, 2, 33, 3, 1 -> after inserting, we will start counting from 1 and not from 2, 3, 4 ->  in those we will just skip!
