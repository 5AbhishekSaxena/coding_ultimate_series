1. Wiggle Subsequence (alternate + and - difference, longest one)
- O(N^2) is easy as we just need need to keep pos, neg at each index and iterate
- But if we see clearly at each index we can use previous one. Keeping one same while increasing other if possible
- UPDATE: Top Down Approach (recursion) is done myself and understood clearly. Better to find recursive with memo way always!
