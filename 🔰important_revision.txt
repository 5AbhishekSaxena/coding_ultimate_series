Questions:
1. Burglar Thief/Pick max adjacent number
2. Next Permutation problem (repeated many times)
3. One Edit distance/ Levenshtein problem
4. Minimum window substring (many similar questions)
5. Inversion of array (Similar to Merge sort)
NOTE: Minimum swaps to sort & count inversions are different question.
      - Count inversions is completely different thing(it asks to check num[i]>num[j] where i<j)
      - Whereas, Minimum swaps just asks to count minimum swaps required.
