📌️ Algorithms:
1. Sorting Techniques | algorithms > sorting
2. KMP- Knuth Morris Pratt String Matching algorithm (How Pi Table works) | algorithm > string > pattern_matching

📌️️ Sorting:
1. Merge sort (divide and conquer) | single items are always sorted | 2 pointer to merge array
      Questions:
            - Count inversions
            - Smallest string

2. Quick Sort (divide and conquer) | pivot (always want to do quickly!) | left to placed pivot are all less | right items are all >
      Questions:
            - kth largest in array

📌️️ Questions:
1. Burglar Thief/Pick max adjacent number
2. Next Permutation problem (repeated many times)
3. One Edit distance/ Levenshtein problem
4. Minimum window substring (many similar questions)
5. Inversion of array (Similar to Merge sort)
NOTE: Minimum swaps to sort & count inversions are different question.
      - Count inversions is completely different thing(it asks to check num[i]>num[j] where i<j)
      - Whereas, Minimum swaps just asks to count minimum swaps required.
6. kth largest in array (Similar to Quick Sort)
7. Angry Birds problem - many problems, similar solution - monotonic Binary Search
8. Maximize the minimum - Game of Greed, monotonic Binary Search
      - (Maximize the minimum something) problem, check if taking values from (1....x) is possible - if yes it's monotonic Binary Search
8. Min Pairs problem - 2 array find smallest absoulte difference picking one from each
