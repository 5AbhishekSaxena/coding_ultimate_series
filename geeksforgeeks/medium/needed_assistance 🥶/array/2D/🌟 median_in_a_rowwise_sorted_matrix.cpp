/**
 * LOGIC: We need to understand that solutions range is limited
 * - It's min value to max value given in the matrix
 * 
 * - Hence, the question is a variant of Monotonic binary search!
 * - Extremely important to understand that- we don't care even if some num doesn't exists
 * - Why? because our BS will take care of that - as when will try to shift left(towards requiredNumsOnLeft) will get the existing number
 * - The above ðŸ‘‰ LINE IS THE CRUX WHY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS QUESTIONS!"
 * - LOGIC: (of this question) We can easily count the nums to the left of the number (& hence we can reach medium like this)
 * 
 * - Through scratch, we can understand that left will be the one which will point to the result at last (as right will go towards left of left)
 * 
 * COMPLEXITY: O(rows * logM)
