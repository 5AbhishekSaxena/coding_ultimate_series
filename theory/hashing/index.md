### HASHING

- For map, multimaps, set all have both ordered & unordered containers

#### Unordered Containers
- O(1) for insert, search, delete
- Implemented using hash-tables
- Not sorted, random position


#### Ordered Containers
- O(logN) for all operations
- Implemented using Tree
- Sorted Random Position

- If sorting is required only then use ordered containers.
