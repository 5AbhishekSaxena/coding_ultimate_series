- DP is optimization over plain recursion. How?
- Let's say you are doing recursion for same input multiple times...
- We can store the result for that input and can save doing it again, this is DP

Example: Fibonnaci using Recursion is Exponential, while using iterative is Linear (Huge difference!)

## 1. Fibonnaci using recursion:

fibo(n) {
    if(n<=1) return n; //imp to return n as sometimes 0 is returned and sometimes 1
    return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2);
}

COMPLEXITY: O(2^N)

- Try for n=5, and check , for (3, 2, 1) multiple times branches are created and recursion happens - this soln could have been saved and used
- If we save somewhere and use - it's DP!

## 2. Fibonnaci using Iterative:

fibo[0]=1; fibo[1]=1; // this is predefined for fibonnaci so do manually!
for(i=2 to n) {
    fibo[i]=fibo[i-1] + fibo[i-2];
}

COMPLEXITY: O(N)
