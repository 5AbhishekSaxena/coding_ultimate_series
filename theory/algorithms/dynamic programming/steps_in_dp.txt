Steps to follow in DP:

1. Think about mathematic formula
How?
- Like in fibonacci, we think f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

2. Create a recusive Tree- in scratch paper
  
3. Code the recusion with Memoization
What Memoization?
- Let's say you are calculating things for input multiple times in recusion
- Example in fibonacci recusion we find things multiple times for a single input
- What if we just store the answer for input and check if we already have answer for that input
- This is called Memoization

4. Observation
- After coding, check by running with some sample input if it's giving expected answer

5. Memoization --> Tabulation
- Just change memoization used in recusion to array (it's easy task, until 4. it was important)

6. Optimization
- Check if further optimization is possible
