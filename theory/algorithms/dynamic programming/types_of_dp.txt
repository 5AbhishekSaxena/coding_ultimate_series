Types of DP Problems:

1. Two/ three pointer problem (fibonacci)
2. String Set - Longest Common Subsequence, Longest Common Substring - (LCS)
3. LIS - Longest Increasing Subsequence
4. Target Set (inputs given, we need to achieve some target)- like Knapsack problem
5. Matrix Chain Multiplication

--- For CP below things are also required ---

1. DP + Bit Masking
2. DP on tree
3. DP on graph
4. DP + Convex Hull
5. DP + Binary Index Tree/ Segment Tree/ Fenwik Tree
6. DP + Trie
7. DP + geometry
8. DP + string optimization
9. DP + Lexicographical String
