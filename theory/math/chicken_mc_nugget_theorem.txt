> Chicken McNugget Theorem
- You have infinite collection of 3, 5 balls and now you have to find 
all numbers which you can form with those- basically (3x+5y)
- Remember 3, 5 are both prime and that's what is required for starting this algo
- Finding all those 2 numbers:

Algo states that:
Largest N which can't be represented as (Ax + By) where A, B are whole numbers
is (x*y - x - y)

- So after (x*y - x - y), all numbers can definitely be formed using (Ax+By)

So, (3*5 - 3 - 5) = 7
- After 7 all numbers can definitely be formed using these 2 Prime num - {3, 5}

NOTE: Before 7 you can find out no. which can be formed manually
