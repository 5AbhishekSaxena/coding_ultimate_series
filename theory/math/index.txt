PRIME FACTORS

- 1) Every composite number(Non Prime) has atleast one prime factor less than
  or equal to the root (<=√num)
- 2) So for any number to be prime, it's important that no prime(which is <=√num) divides it! 
- NOTE: There can be max 1 prime factor possible for a composite number i.e >√num
  WHY? Because 1) is true & if >1 factor >√num are there then result > num!
 
-1) '1' is not a prime, 2 is the only even & least prime no (that's why while factorization done first)

LEFT/RIGHT SHIFT

1. Left shift:
  - x<<3 means (x * pow(2, 3))
  - So if we do x<<1 -> means double up x -> why? (x * pow(2, 1))

2. Right shift
  - x>>3 means (x / pow(2, 3))
  - So if we do x>>1 -> means half x -> why? (x / pow(2, 1))
