PRIME FACTORS

- 1) Every composite number(Non Prime) has atleast one prime factor less than
  or equal to the root (<=√num)
- 2) So for any number to be prime, it's important that no prime(which is <=√num) divides it! 
- NOTE: There can be max 1 prime factor possible for a composite number
  WHY? Because 1) is true & if >1 factor >√num are there then result > num!
 
-1) '1' is not a prime, 2 is the only even & least prime no (that's why while factorization done first)
