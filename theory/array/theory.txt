1. An static array can't be initialized during run time;
- int a = 2;
- int arr[a] = {0}; ❌
> arr can't be initialized during run time (Do it by running a loop)

- Note: you can do 'int a; cin>>a; arr[a];' and later run a loop to do operations!

2. Use dynamic array in case you want to initialize array dynamically
- Create array in heap
- Assign array to a pointer
    - int a=12;
    - int *arr = new int[a]{0}; ✅

3. For static array, to define all items as 0 or -1 use memset
- memset(arr, 0, sizeof(arr)); "last param is the sizeof complete array"
