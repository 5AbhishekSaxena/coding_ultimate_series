- Use __gcd(a, b) - to find gcd of 2 items, for lcm it's not there!

- % doesn't work sometimes when 10**9+7 is required with result
 > To do it, there are 2 things:
 1. Do that % at every step in loop or recursion
 2. Don't do directly use -> fmod();
 > fmod(num, pow(10, 9)+7) --> success! #include<math.h> required!
