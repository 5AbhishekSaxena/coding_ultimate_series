- Use __gcd(a, b) - to find gcd of 2 items, for lcm it's not there!

- % doesn't work sometimes when 10**9+7 is required with result
 > To do it, there are 2 things:
 1. Do that % at every step in loop or recursion
 2. Don't do directly use -> fmod();
 > fmod(num, pow(10, 9)+7) --> success! #include<math.h> required!
3. Why is integer (2^31) - 1 ?? - ^31 is coz, 1 bit is used for sign, and '- 1' is coz counting starting from 0
... usually it should have been ending with even but as counting starts form 0, it would be - 1 (so a odd number)
